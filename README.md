This Node.js application uses clustering to optimize performance by spawning multiple worker processes, each handling HTTP requests. The master process coordinates worker creation. Workers serve routes such as '/' displaying process ID and '/timer' with simulated delays. This design maximizes CPU core utilization, enhancing concurrency and overall efficiency.
